# Design patterns for production grade Go services
## Material for the GoLab 2020 Workshop

## Prerequisites

As an intermediate workshop, familiarity with the basics of the Go programming language is expected. As a reference, you have already completed (or should be able to complete) [A Tour of Go](https://tour.golang.org/).

A previous experience in writing Go services may be useful, but not required.

To install Go 1.15 and configure your environment properly, follow the instructions [here](https://golang.org/doc/install).

During the workshop, we will try the example code with some HTTP requests. `curl` is perfectly fine, but it may be easier to use a tool like [Insomnia Core](https://insomnia.rest/download/core/?) or [Postman](https://www.postman.com/downloads/).

## Setup test
